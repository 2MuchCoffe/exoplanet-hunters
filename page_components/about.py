    ## What is This?
    
    Exoplanet Hunter is an AI-powered system that automatically detects exoplanets from NASA telescope data. 
    Using machine learning trained on thousands of confirmed discoveries, our tool can instantly analyze star 
    brightness measurements and identify potential planetary systems with 93% accuracy.

    ## How It Works: The Transit Method
    
    When a planet passes in front of its star (a "transit"), it blocks a tiny amount of starlight. Our AI 
    learned to recognize these patterns and distinguish real planets from false positives like:
    - Eclipsing binary stars
    - Instrumental noise
    - Stellar variability

        ### The Science
        
        **Transit Detection:**
        - Planet blocks ~0.01-1% of starlight
        - Creates periodic dips in brightness
        - Depth reveals planet size
        - Duration reveals orbit
        
        **Our Approach:**
        - 9 core NASA measurements
        - 13 engineered features based on physics
        - XGBoost machine learning
        - 93.03% detection accuracy

    ## Data Sources
    
    This tool works with official NASA data from:
    
    **Kepler Mission** (2009-2018)
    - 9,564 stars analyzed
    - 2,700+ exoplanets confirmed
    - Deep survey of Cygnus-Lyra region
    
    **TESS Mission** (2018-present)
    - All-sky survey (ongoing)
    - 400+ exoplanets confirmed
    - Brighter, closer stars
    
    Our model is trained on data from both missions, making it versatile and robust across different 
    stellar types and observing conditions.

    ## Technical Details
    
    **Algorithm:** XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
    - 200 decision trees
    - Maximum depth: 6 levels
    - Learning rate: 0.1
    
    **Validation:**
    - 5-fold cross-validation
    - 80/20 train-test split
    - Stratified sampling (maintains planet ratio)
    
    **Feature Engineering:**
    - Physics-based calculations (Kepler's laws, transit photometry)
    - Signal-to-noise ratios (using NASA error columns)
    - Habitable zone determination (stellar luminosity-based)
    - Planet type classification (radius-based)

    ## Limitations
    
    **What we can detect:**
    - ‚úÖ Transiting exoplanets (planets that cross in front of their star)
    - ‚úÖ From Kepler or TESS mission data
    - ‚úÖ With sufficient signal-to-noise ratio
    
    **What we cannot detect:**
    - ‚ùå Non-transiting planets (wrong orbital orientation)
    - ‚ùå Planets found via other methods (radial velocity, direct imaging)
    - ‚ùå Planets around very faint or very bright stars (data quality issues)
    
    **Accuracy considerations:**
    - 93% accuracy means ~7% error rate
    - False positives: 3.5% (some non-planets flagged as planets)
    - False negatives: 9.1% (some planets missed)
    - Always verify results with follow-up observations!

    ## üí° Our Approach
    
    As first-year students tackling a complex astrophysics challenge, we took an unconventional approach. 
    Coming from a commerce background, Munjid used AI as a teacher‚Äîleveraging prompt engineering and machine 
    learning not just to build the solution, but to understand the underlying science of exoplanet detection. 
    This meta approach‚Äîusing AI to learn AI for space science‚Äîrepresents how accessible advanced technology 
    has become for motivated learners from any background.
